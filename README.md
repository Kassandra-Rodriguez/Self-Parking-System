# Self-Parking-System
A modular and cost-effective autonomous parking system utilizing Raspberry Pi, Arduino, and sensor fusion to enable real-time navigation and obstacle avoidance.

## About the Project
This project was developed as part of my Master’s in Software Engineering coursework at the University of Michigan - Dearborn. The goal was to design a low-cost, scalable autonomous parking system that integrates ultrasonic sensors, computer vision, and motor control algorithms to enable self-parking capabilities.

## Features
- Sensor Fusion – Combines ultrasonic sensor data and computer vision for obstacle detection and accurate path planning.
- Motor Control Algorithms – Uses Python-based control logic to execute smooth and precise parking maneuvers.
- 3D-Printed Chassis – Designed modular, customizable housing to keep hardware costs low.
- Real-Time Processing – Implements Raspberry Pi for decision-making and Arduino for motor control to ensure seamless navigation.
- Scalable & Open-Source – The system is modular, allowing for enhancements like LiDAR integration or improved AI-based decision-making.
